/* Row-major edge accumulator, used while a topology is being generated.
 *
 * The dense n*n scratch buffer this replaces costs 8 bytes for every possible
 * connection, whether or not an edge is there. This stores only the edges that
 * exist, at 16 bytes each (column index plus weight), so it is smaller
 * whenever fewer than about a third of the possible connections are present.
 * Note that is a constant-factor saving proportional to connectivity, not a
 * change in growth rate: at a fixed connectivity both still scale with n*n.
 *
 * per_row_hint pre-sizes every row so that generation does not have to keep
 * reallocating. Pass the expected number of edges per row (with a little
 * headroom, since a row that outgrows its hint costs a copy), or 0 to grow
 * purely on demand.
 *
 * The semantics deliberately mirror the dense buffer it replaces:
 *   edge_rows_set(er,i,j,w)  ==  W[i*n + j] = w      (overwrites in place)
 *   edge_rows_set(er,i,j,0)  ==  W[i*n + j] = 0.0    (erases the edge)
 *   edge_rows_has(er,i,j)    ==  W[i*n + j] != 0.0
 * and csr_build_from_rows drops exact zeros just as csr_build_from_dense
 * does, so the matrix built either way is identical. */
